## 4 Types of Story Beats

Beats can refer to several different kinds of emotional moments or plot points. Examples of beats you might find in a screenplay include:

1. Events. From graduation parties and proms, to battles and boxing matches, large social gatherings and events offer many opportunities for characters to express their views or desires, interact with secondary characters, and advance plot development both within the main story and outside of it.
2. Realizations. Realizations are often small, subtle, and quiet moments that occur after some buildup. Perhaps a character witnesses a gesture or glance that reveals their best friend’s betrayal, or discovers that there’s a reason she keeps getting passed up for promotions. Realization beats help characters make decisions based on the information they have.
3. Resolutions. Resolution beats tend to come early in the story, and stem from a character’s desire to change the status quo or conduct an experiment. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a clear example of how a simple resolution made early on in the film impacts the entire plot: for her advice column, protagonist Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) resolves to drive a man away within 10 days.
4. Interactions. Throughout the course of his or her journey, a character meets allies and antagonists, characters who provide additional conflict and dimension to the story. Notable interactions (for instance a hero facing off with the villain in the final battle) are important beats that shape the plot. Conversations fall under this category as well: even seemingly minor dialogue, like a teenager and her father arguing over curfew, can shape the outcome of the rest of the story. 

In the beginning some information can be given extra to bring up the reader faster to the story.
